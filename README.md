#FedEx Delivery Time Analysis and Prediction

This project involves analyzing delivery performance data from FedEx using Python and various data science libraries. The primary goal is to examine the relationship between planned and actual delivery/shipment times and identify patterns or inefficiencies. The project leverages a dataset (fedex.csv) containing features such as:

Year, Month, and Day of Week

Actual and Planned Shipment Time

Actual and Planned Delivery Time

Carrier Information


The analysis includes data preprocessing using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn (with techniques such as one-hot encoding and MinMax scaling), as well as visualization with matplotlib and seaborn. The insights gained from this analysis could be used to predict delays and improve logistics planning.
